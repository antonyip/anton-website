#### Agenda

> Discussion about the state of Aragon, near future plans and decisions that need to be made. 10 min presentations with slides from team members, in which each one will run through the most important things we have done during the month, the problems they have found, and what they plan to do next month (that can be a bit blurry, and that's fine)
