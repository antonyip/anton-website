# [Riot](https://riot.im)

### Projects currently using this platform

- [Parity](https://parity.io)
- [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network)
- [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network)

### Pros
- Federated architecture: Any user in any community could talk to another one in another different community, seamlessly
- Decentralized infrastructure; Even though matrix.org provides everything needed for Projects and users, self-deployed instances are also supported and widely used on the Matrix standard
- Server Deployment supported: Be in control of your own data
- End-to-end encryption for private messages and public as well as closed group chats: Useful for internal communications, for example
- Built using React, easy to maintain and work on
- Numeral user-levels, easy to set different levels for usergroups, ie. 50 for Moderator, 100 for Admin
- Communities: Ability to create Communities provides the project ability to create multiple channels within their Community and visible to users within the Community, removes bloating from the interface
- Communities will provide ability to do Community wide bans (Unsure if a community can join a community to create an umbrella community for ie. Ethereum Community wide bans)
- They have message pinning, message editing and reactions coming by the end of 2017
- Reactions coming by the end of 2017
- Basic moderation and rich moderation API
- Roadmap for upvotes/downvotes on messages and per-member reputation
- Usernames can contain flags, similar to Reddit, to signal status in the community
- Notifications: Work on web, desktop and mobile, includes notifications inbox
- A huge range of clients that support the Matrix standard, Riot is just one of them
- Bridges: Allows you to mirror the messages from Slack, Gitter, IRC, Twitter, Telegram, SMS and more
- Native mobile clients for Android and iOS, and [desktop too](https://github.com/mujx/nheko)
- Mobile clients are superior to Rocket.Chat's, work well
- Has arbitrarily finely grained ACLs (based on a 'power level' system where users get a numeric power level from 0 to 100)

### Cons

- UX is bad, specially for newcomers
- Encryption / key exchange is buggy and keeps causing issues in encrypted channels, unfortunately
- Lack of message pinning, editing and reactions, but as seen above, they're coming by the end of 2017
- They are having [funding](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/2977) [issues](https://matrix.org/blog/2017/07/07/a-call-to-arms-supporting-matrix/) and require a very significant amount of capital to continue with the project for the next 18 months, at least. *This might be a lesser issue, but not confirmed*
- No customization options in the client for Projects
- Self-deployed instances aren't necessary, but would incur monthly costs if used
